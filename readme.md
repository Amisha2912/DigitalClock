# Digital Clock Project

## Topic
This project is a **Digital Clock** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It displays the current time in real-time and is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Features
- **Real-time Display:** The clock updates in real-time without requiring a page refresh.
- **Current Time Format:** The time is displayed in a 12-hour format (with AM/PM).
